In this project I was tasked to make a website for an online store for a fictional company called Rainydays. 
The purpose of this project was to learn more about JavaScript and to fetch products from an external API. 
We were tasked to use Wordpress as our API, with One.com as a host. We also learned more about different plugins for Wordpress, such as E-Commerce.
